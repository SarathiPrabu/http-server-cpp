# C++ Socket Programming Server

This repository is my personal project to learn about socket programming and deepen my knowledge of C++. The project focuses on building a custom server using C++ to explore and understand the fundamentals of socket programming, enabling efficient communication between devices over a network. The server is designed to handle multiple client connections concurrently, demonstrating basic concepts such as socket creation, binding, listening, and data transmission. This project also includes the use of modern C++ features.

## Features
- **Socket Creation**: Establish and configure server sockets.
- **Concurrent Connections**: Handle multiple client connections concurrently, showcasing efficient multithreading techniques.
- **Data Transmission**: Send and receive messages between server and clients.
- **Error Handling**: Implement basic error checking and handling for robustness.
- **Modern C++ Features**: Utilizes `std::optional` for safe and expressive handling of optional values.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README to set up and run the server on your machine.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming
